### IBSS (_ad-hoc_)

The network topology represented by the IBSS scenario is the same as illustrated in the figure below. 

![Network topology](https://github.com/ramonfontes/wireless-mesh-book/blob/main/minimal-topo.png?raw=true)

In order to run the IBSS scenario you have to run ```examples/adhoc.py```, as follows.

```
~/mininet-wifi$ sudo python examples/adhoc.py
```

Now, try communicating **sta1** with **sta2** and **sta3**, exactly as below. 

```
mininet-wifi> sta1 ping -c1 sta2
PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=2046 ms

--- 10.0.0.2 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 2046.137/2046.137/2046.137/0.000 ms
mininet-wifi> sta1 ping -c1 sta3
PING 10.0.0.3 (10.0.0.3) 56(84) bytes of data.
From 10.0.0.1 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable

--- 10.0.0.3 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 0 received, +1 errors, 100% packet loss, time 0ms
```

As we can see, **sta1** cannot communicate with sta3, since **sta2** was not instructed on how to forward data traffic to **sta3** in order to allow **sta1** and **sta3** to establish communication with each other.


In wireless ad-hoc networks, intermediate nodes do not automatically route traffic, as is done in wireless mesh networks. To do so, you first need to either setup a routing protocol or configure routing tables. So let us look at how this configuring can be done.


To do so, execute the following commands.

```
mininet-wifi> sta1 ip route add 10.0.0.3 via 10.0.0.2
mininet-wifi> sta3 ip route add 10.0.0.1 via 10.0.0.2
mininet-wifi> sta2 echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

The first command instructs sta1 that, in case it needs to talk to **sta3**, the packet must first pass through **sta2**. The second, in turn, indicates that for the packet to arrive at **sta1**, from **sta3**, it must also pass through **sta2**. The third one instructs **sta2** to forward packets addressed to **sta1** and **sta3**.


Once all the necessary routing settings have been made, we can confirm them by viewing their routing tables, as follows.

```
mininet-wifi> sta1 route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination Gateway  Genmask         Flags Metric Ref  Use Iface
10.0.0.0    0.0.0.0  255.0.0.0       U     0      0    0 sta1-wlan0
10.0.0.3    10.0.0.2 255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0    0 sta1-wlan0

mininet-wifi> sta3 route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination Gateway  Genmask         Flags Metric Ref  Use Iface
10.0.0.0    0.0.0.0  255.0.0.0       U     0      0    0 sta3-wlan0
10.0.0.1    10.0.0.2 255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0    0 sta3-wlan0
```

Now, let us try again to ```ping``` between **sta1** and **sta3**. 

```
mininet-wifi> sta1 ping -c1 sta3
PING 10.0.0.3 (10.0.0.3) 56(84) bytes of data.
From 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 Redirect Host(New nexthop: 10.0.0.3)
64 bytes from 10.0.0.3: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=20.1 ms

--- 10.0.0.3 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 20.167/20.167/20.167/0.000 ms
```

As you can see, communication can now be successfully established thanks to the static routing configured on the nodes.

Finally, you can get some information about the ad-hoc network by using ```iw```.

```
mininet-wifi> sta1 iw dev sta1-wlan0 info
Interface sta1-wlan0

	wdev 0x7300000001

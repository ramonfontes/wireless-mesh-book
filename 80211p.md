So considering that you have all the requirements satisfied you can go further and run \textit{examples/ieee80211p.py}, as follows.

```
~/mininet-wifi$ sudo python examples/ieee80211p.py
```

By using the \textit{iw reg get} we can confirm that 5.9GHz is supported by \texttt{sta1} and should be supported by the other nodes that are part of the network topology. 

```
mininet-wifi> sta1 iw reg get
global
country DE: DFS-ETSI
	(2400 - 2483 @ 40), (N/A, 20), (N/A)
	(5150 - 5350 @ 80), (N/A, 20), (N/A), NO-OUTDOOR
	(5470 - 5725 @ 80), (N/A, 26), (0 ms), DFS
	(5850 - 5925 @ 20), (N/A, 20), (N/A), NO-CCK, IR-CONCURRENT
	(57240 - 65880 @ 2160), (N/A, 40), (N/A), NO-OUTDOOR
```

Below we can also confirm that the interface is really running outside the context of a basic service set (OCB, earlier ``802.11p''). OCB (outside the context of a basic service set - BSS) is are used for vehicular communications, as ``Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments'' and it is a mode of operation in which a STA is not a member of a BSS and does not utilize IEEE Std 802.11 authentication, association, or data confidentiality.

```
mininet-wifi> sta1 iw dev sta1-wlan0 info
Interface sta1-wlan0
	ifindex 162
	wdev 0x6d00000001
	addr 02:00:00:00:00:00
	type outside context of a BSS
	wiphy 109
	channel 181 (5905 MHz), width: 20 MHz (no HT), center1: 5905 MHz
	txpower 17.00 dBm
```

Finally, we can try communicate sta1 and sta3 with the ping command.

```
mininet-wifi> sta1 ping -c2 sta3

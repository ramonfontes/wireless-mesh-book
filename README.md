All the scenarios covered in this chapter approach aspects related to its execution up to the final objective, where station can communication with other stations that immediately within their radio range or one that is outside their radio range by deploying an intermediate station to be the router to route the packet from the source toward the destination.
 
 
You can clone the Mininet-WiFi source code by using the following command line, which consists of the instruction git clone followed by a link to Mininet-WiFi's Github repository.


Mininet-WiFi relies on Linux Kernel components to function properly. Of the different Linux distributions that can be used to this end, we recommend Ubuntu, since Mininet-WiFi was extensively tested on it. From now on, consider having Mininet-WiFi installed in order to be able to run all the scenarios proposed throughout this chapter.


For the mesh point scenario, consider running \textit{examples/mesh.py}.
The topology represented in this script consists of three station arranged according to Figure~\ref{fig:mesh} operating on channel 5.
